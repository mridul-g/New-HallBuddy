HallBuddy
==================================

This application was made as a course project of [CS253](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/isaha/Courses/sdo22.shtml/): Software Development and Operations in spring 2024 under 
the guidance of [Dr. Indranil Saha](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/isaha/).

Hall Buddy is a merged platform designed for the residents of various halls at IITK to access day to day hall functionalities. This portal aims to 
digitalize various services provided by the hall that includes mess, canteen and various other services. 

Broadly, the application will support the following:

* Students can book the hall's guest room.
* Students can maintain a digital cleaning log of their rooms and the admin can export room-cleaning data
* Students can use the software's complaint management system to lodge complaints.
* Students can view their pending hostel-dues and pay these dues.
* Special permissions have been provided to the Hostel Manager to facilitate all these services.
